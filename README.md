Link Library 

# What and why?
"Oh! Theres a website for that... now what was it called again?"

Ever find yourself searching through your browser history for the link to that cool website you found earlier? Or, wondering where to write it down so you can go back to it later? 

When I come across a website that I want to revisit I: hope I'll remember it if I need to come back to it later, save it in chrome by continuing my browsing in a new tab (I have about 200 chrome tabs open on my phone for this reason), or - if I want to make absolutely sure I can access it later - I'll save it in a notes page. 

To put simply, current methods of link saving are disorganized, inconvenient, and inneficient - this is where Link Library comes in. 

Link Library is an app that would function as a library for links, allowing users to keep track of all the cool sites they find in an organized and efficient way. 

Similar in concept to tiktok collections or instagram saved pages, Link Library would enable a user to save and categorize links so that they can easily revisit them later. 

The user would be able to:
 - design their own library system by categorizing links in a way which suits their interests (shelves)
 - Give the links relevant titles and summaries 
 - Comment reminders of why they used the site and what cool things they can find there
 - use a lookup system for easy access (through categories and searching)


# For whom?
While Link Library would benefit just about anyone who consistently uses the web, it might work especially well for: 

- students: to keep track of (and organize) websites that aid their learning across numerous topics and throughout different classes 
- teachers: who recommend visiting certain websites to aid in the learning of different material (each category (shelf) would be for a different topic and would have the respective links) 


# How?
In the user journey of a **serial shopper**, the shopper might: 

 1. come across a website with a sparkly shoe that is perfect for a new years party  
 2. copy the link
 3. open up library link app and navigate to "fancy footwear" section 
 4. within "fancy footwear" section, navigate to "new years" shelf
 5. click +add button and paste the link to create a new item on the shelf
 6. create a title "sparkly heels" (or autofil with website title)
 7. add a summary "red pair would go perfectly with my black dress (green and purple shades also available)" (or skip)
 8. click checkmark to add it to shelf 

 When accessing later, the user would: 

 1. open library links app
 2. navigate to (or search for): "fancy footwear" section -->"new years" shelf --> "sparkly heels" item
 3. click "sparkly heels" item to access the link 
 

# Scope
While the general structure for this app is simple, I believe there is huge potential to add interesting features (for instance, library sharing and viewing - as well as other features that are common in social media apps) which would add to the complexity of the implementation and allow the group to add functionalities given the amount of available time.
